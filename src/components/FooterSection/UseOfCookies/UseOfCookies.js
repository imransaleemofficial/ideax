        <p className='para_useofcookies'>“Cookies” are small files or pieces of information sent out by this website. These cookie files can
                be stored on your computer or mobile device when you visit the website. They record

        <h2 className='heading_useofcookies'>How we use cookies? </h2>
        <p className='para_useofcookies'>We use cookies to make it easier for you to use our website and to distinguish your user
                preferences from those of other visitors to our site. Without cookies, a website is like a goldfish
                that loses its memory every time you visit a new page. By placing cookies on your device, our
                website remembers your language preference, for example. 
        </p>
        <p className='para_useofcookies'>We also use cookies to compile anonymous, aggregate statistics, so that we have a clear idea of
                how visitors use our website. We use this information to optimise the user experience. 
        </p>
        <p className='para_useofcookies'>The information we collect is used only within our organisation. We do not pass your data along
                to third parties.

        <h4 className='heading_useofcookies'>Essential cookies</h4>
        <p className='para_useofcookies'>These cookies are required in order for the website to function. Since these cookies are essential
                for the website's functionality, you cannot refuse these cookies without this having an impact on
                the functioning of our website. You can remove these cookies, though. For more information

        <h4 className='heading_useofcookies'>Analytical cookies</h4>
        <p className='para_useofcookies'>These types of cookies collect information about the behaviour of website visitors and the
                performance of the website. For example, data about how long someone stays on the website is
                recorded. This allows us to improve the user experience of the website. This information is
                collected completely anonymously.
        </p>
        <h4 className='heading_useofcookies'>Marketing cookies</h4>
        <p className='para_useofcookies'>Marketing cookies are used to monitor the surfing behaviour of visitors. Based on this
                information, a user profile is created which allows more personalised information to be sent out
                to you. This website does not use marketing cookies.
